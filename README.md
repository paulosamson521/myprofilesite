# Description
This website is built with the latest Umbraco version 7.12.1

I've used the Grid approach to give the editor the flexibility to create components and provide them with a representation of the content in the back office.

# Credential
To access Umbraco back office, please use this credential:<br/>
Username: diversifyoss@umbraco.com<br/>
Password: diversifyosspass1234

# Setup
Basically, all you need to do is to open the solution on Visual Studio 2015 or higher. It will download all node packages when opening and it will install all required nuget packages when you run the application.<br/>
The database is also included in the App_Data folder. 

# Umbraco Packages
